# Predection-of-ocular-disease-using-fundus-images-using-CNN
Deep learning based recognition of ocular disease in Fundus images. Detection of Glaucoma, Cataract and Diabetic Retinopathy.

The aim of this system is to develop a deep learning model for the recognition of ocular diseases in fundus images, specifically glaucoma, cataract, and diabetic retinopathy. The system utilizes a dataset of fundus images that are labeled with disease categories to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The CNN model consists of four convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers, with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation used in the convolutional layers. Image augmentation is used to increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting. The model is trained and validated using the training and testing datasets, respectively, with early stopping used to prevent overfitting. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results show that the model achieves a high level of accuracy in recognizing the three ocular diseases in the fundus images, demonstrating the potential for deep learning models to aid in the diagnosis of ocular diseases.
